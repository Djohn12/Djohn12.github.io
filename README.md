# This is my first personnal website \o/

## Warning, big things coming up !


## Ideally, this website will host :

* My portfolio
* My CV
* Some informations about me and what I do these days
* Some blog posts I plan to do to keep up with my new carrier (and hobby) in web development

**About Language Side Note**

This README is in English but all the site content will actually be written in French as I don't think I'll have other than French readers.
I don't even intend to have any reader to be honest ^^
